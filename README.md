# Employee Wellbeing Platform

The **Employee Wellbeing Platform** is a web application designed to foster a healthy corporate workspace. It allows employees to complete wellbeing check-ins, discuss feedback on an open forum, report concerns anonymously, praise peers, and redeem reward points for professional development opportunities.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Quick Start (With Docker)
To build and run the entire application using Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the directory
cd employee-wellbeing

# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run container in background (compiles Next.js & seeds SQLite)
docker-compose up --build
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

---

### 2. Manual Start (Without Docker)
Ensure you have Node.js 22 LTS or newer installed.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy example environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Synchronize SQLite schema using Drizzle ORM
npm run db:push

# Seed the database with mock accounts, surveys, posts, etc.
npm run db:seed

# Run local development server
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Default Credentials

The seed script registers these default accounts with password: `Password123!`

| Email | Password | Role | Department |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rahul@company.com` | `Password123!` | Employee | Engineering |
| `hr@company.com` | `Password123!` | HR Representative | People & Culture |
